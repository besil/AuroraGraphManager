AuroraGraphManager
==================

Aurora Graph Manager part of the software I developed for my MS thesis in Computer Science.
The thesis was about community detection in big graphs.

Aurora is an efficient implementation for directed, undirected, weighted and unweihted graphs, written in Java.
Most of the performance is given by the fastutil project (http://fastutil.di.unimi.it).

I'm rewriting the code in Java 8, with functional idioms. With the original implementation, we could handle
graphs with 300 milions of edges in a 60 Gb server.
